### What I learned

This Project seemed like an easy one when i came across it but when i started it, it didn't seem so, but i'm glad i got it working, tho i know some part of my code look a bit messy. I just learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and i decided to build using what i had learnt. Getting to understand how event listeners work including the different types of event listeneres was key for me in this project.

This line of code was one of the pretty stuff i did, took me a while to figure it out tho ðŸ˜ƒ

```js
document.querySelector('.bill-calc__input--custom').addEventListener('keyup', func);
```

### Continued development

Going Forwards, i'll spend time learning JavaScript and resharpening my CSS skill â˜º.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50252232/input-type-number-onchange-triggering-late?utm_source=pocket_mylist) - This helped me understand types of event listeners and how it works and it gave me a clue on how to fix some bugs i was having.
